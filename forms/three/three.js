/*
Write a program that gets two numbers from the user, 
then use a function to tell whether they are both even or not. 
Also use a boolean operator. Then in the main program, 
tell the user what was found using this format: 
      The results of our test:  both numbers are even.
Note: you may need the Mod operator %. This is a cousin of 
the divide / operator. It gives you the remainder of a division. 
For example, 5%3  (read 5 mod 3) = 2 (that is, 5 divided by 3 is 
1 remainder 2 - mod reports the remainder).

// Code
/*
let number1 = Number(prompt("Enter a number."))
let number2 = Number(prompt("Enter another number."))

if (number1%2>0 || number2%2>0) {
  console.log(`The results of our test: either or both of the numbers are odd.`)
} else {
  console.log(`The results of our test:  both numbers are even.`)
}
